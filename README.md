A 3D City Engine using OSM and SRTM data for my thesis at Politecnico di Milano. 
Copyright (C) 2015  Berke Cagkan Toptas

**Note:** OpenGL version of this city engine is no longer developed.I had to move my source to Unity3D engine because I could not find enough time to code engine side details as my planned graduation date getting close.

**Here is Unity3D C# repository of same project :** https://bitbucket.org/CagkanToptas/polimi-osm-city-engine-unity3d

### Here are some Screen Shots from current version : ###
